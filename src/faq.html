                Creagoo is a mobile developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Dybka Daniil and I develop games
                for people. I have other projects as well,
                which you can find out about at
                <a href="//dybka.ru/en.html" class="link--underline">

            <p>
                I decided to start developing mobile projects
                out of interest. The first developed project
                — Babka On The Hunt.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game is made in the 2D platformer genre because of
                simplicity of project development. By the way, the genre
                2D is chosen not because of the simplicity of development, but
                rather the simplicity of perception. Yes, and it often turns out,
                that the games come out undemanding and better optimized.

        <h2 id="p2">Creagoo Development</h2>
        <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
            <p>
                Unfortunately, but in 2023 I do not plan to
                develop new projects and
                publish them under the name Creagoo.
            </p>
            <p>
                To a greater extent, this is due to employment and
                lack of interest. But I'm still interested in helping
                people develop projects.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="p3">How Creagoo was born</h2>
        <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
            <p>
                I came up with my name Creagoo in 2019,
                when I started developing my first project.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that time, I thought for a long time what is
                Creagoo is a team or individual developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a while, the websites mentioned "we".
                It looked weird because I was alone.
                As a result, I decided that Creagoo is an individual
                developer.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 id="p4">What does "Creagoo" mean</h2>
        <div class="fs-4 border-bottom" style="margin-bottom: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px">
            <p>
                Creagoo is an abbreviation of
                the phrase "Create a good". Means
                "do well."
            </p>
            <p>
                The slogan may seem obvious,
                but it accurately defined the further development of Creagoo.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="a1">Commerce, advertising</h3>
        <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
            <p>
                For all the time in Creagoo projects and on the website
                not a single advertisement was placed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is due to Creagoo's policy: Don't talk
                about offers that I would not use myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that any advertising on the site or games
                — this is what I would use myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach helps to sort the incoming offers perfectly
                advertising bookmakers, casinos and betting.
                <span class="text-muted">By the way, such proposals have already been received.</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="a2">Use of site materials</h3>
        <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
            <p>
                You should consider the terms of use of the Creagoo site(s)

                The use of the materials of the games or the Creagoo website(s)
