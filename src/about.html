                        I decided to start developing mobile projects
                        out of interest. The first developed project
                        — Babka On The Hunt.

                        This game is made in the 2D platformer genre because of
                        simplicity of project development. By the way, the genre
                        2D is chosen not because of the simplicity of development, but
                        rather the simplicity of perception. Yes, and it often turns out,
                        that the games come out undemanding and better optimized.

                        Unfortunately, but in 2023 I do not plan to
                        develop new projects and
                        publish them under the name Creagoo.

                    <p>
                        To a greater extent, this is due to employment and
                        lack of interest. But I'm still interested in helping
                        people develop projects.

                <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
                    <p>
                        I came up with my name Creagoo in 2019,
                        when I started developing my first project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that time, I thought for a long time what is
                        Creagoo is a team or individual developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a while, the websites mentioned "we".
                        It looked weird because I was alone.
                        As a result, I decided that Creagoo is an individual
                        developer.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2 id="p4">What does "Creagoo" mean</h2>
                <div class="fs-4 border-bottom" style="margin-bottom: 50px; padding-bottom: 50px">
                    <p>
                        Creagoo is an abbreviation of
                        the phrase "Create a good". Means
                        "do well."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The slogan may seem obvious,
                        but it accurately defined the further development of Creagoo.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3 id="a1">Commerce, advertising</h3>
                <div class="fs-4" style="margin-bottom: 50px">
                    <p>
                        For all the time in Creagoo projects and on the website
                        not a single advertisement was placed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is due to Creagoo's policy: Don't talk
                        about offers that I would not use myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means that any advertising on the site or games
                        — this is what I would use myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach helps to sort the incoming offers perfectly
                        advertising bookmakers, casinos and betting.
