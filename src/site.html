            <p>
                In 2019, I made my first website. He worked in PHP and took pages from
                MySQL databases. I created these pages in the input field, because of this
                I couldn't program comfortably. I designed each page separately.
                There was no hint of even the slightest automation.

                I decided to take the next step towards abandoning the use of MySQL and became
                create your own pages in simple HTML. At this time I didn't use modularity,
                but I have already abandoned the use of PHP and a database for storing pages.
                The solution may be relevant for simple pages on the site.

            <p>
                Before using WordPress, which I have already prepared for installation, I had
                it's interesting to try a new framework for myself, which I've heard about many times.
                My acquaintance almost didn't work out, because I didn't have enough time,
                to study this framework deeply enough, therefore
                I decided to stop using it.

            <h2>4. WordPress</h2>
            <p>
                And so, the longâ€”awaited solution is CMS WordPress, a page automator for the site.
                I was happy to use it. Creating new pages with it was really
                easier than doing everything manually. But after a while I decided to change this decision
                due to poor optimization of pages created using CMS WordPress.
                The resulting sites were loaded unreasonably long.

            <p>
                However, due to poor optimization of the WordPress CMS, I decided to return to the study of creation
                sites independently. To simplify development, I decided to use the Bootstrap framework,
                this time I had more time to study it, so I managed to "make friends"
                with this framework. I still use it for websites.

            <h2>6. Pet-project at Laravel</h2>
            <p>
                It became interesting for me to try to create a test project on Laravel. By this time
                I have already actively used PHP to automate the creation of websites, let these solutions
                and they weren't technically perfect, they allowed me to simplify development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied Laravel and I didn't like it at all. Unfortunately, but in the case of Laravel
                this framework did not suit me because of its large size, inconvenient assembly and
                constant errors in the assembly. I am glad that other developers have managed
                to "make friends" with this framework, perhaps I will one day succeed
                to do this, but for now I have decided to abandon the use of Laravel in
                creating websites.

            <h2>7. Clear PHP</h2>
            <p>
                My latest projects are assembled in an assembly with PHP and the Bootstrap framework, which
                I use it to quickly launch websites. This version of the assembly has a great
                number of advantages: modularity, backend handler, multilingualism of the site,
                the presence of JavaScript on the site and the availability of content.

                But the solution is not without jambs. At a minimum, the end user gets
                the page is as I will write it. I don't have the latest processing
                content, which complicates development for me. Me in my project
                you need to take into account different factors, such as prefixes in CSS, correct
                links and a picture tag for optimizing images.

            <p>
                And at the moment I'm using build automation using Gulm.
                I have been using this system for only a week, but already with its help
                creating websites has become much easier and better for me. The final code is obtained
                clean, beautiful and with all the right supports, it's great.
